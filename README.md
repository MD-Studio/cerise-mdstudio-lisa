# Cerise specialisation for MDStudio and LISA (SURFSARA)

This repository contains a Cerise specialisation for MDStudio and Lisa(Surfsara).
It's work in progress.

For more information about Lisa see the [surfsara page](https://userinfo.surfsara.nl/systems/lisa).

## Running

### Install the service via Docker

Get the specialised service from Docker:

```bash
docker pull mdstudio/cerise-mdstudio-lisa:develop
```

### Start it

```bash
docker run --name=cerise-mdstudio-lisa -p 29593-29594:29593-29594 --env CERISE_USERNAME=<username> --env CERISE_PASSWORD=<password> mdstudio/cerise-mdstudio-lisa:develop
```
This will give a warning about the Slurm version not being supported, which
you can safely ignore.

If this is the first time you run this Cerise specialisation, it will stage a
bunch of files to a directory named `.cerise` in your home directory on LISA.
This may take a bit of time, so it may take a moment for the service to start
processing jobs. You can submit them right away though.

Note that inserting the user name and password via an environment variable is
not ideal, amongst others it leaves a copy of them in your `~/.bash_history`
(from where you may want to delete it now, although it should be only readable
to you yourself). Overlay-mounting a file would be another option, but that
means that the username and password are stored on disk. If we start the service
from Python using docker-py, then the environment variables would probably be
the better option.

### Run a job

Now we can submit an example Gromit/GROMACS job, using a virtual environment to
keep the dependencies away from the rest of the system:

```bash
cd examples/
virtualenv -p python3 venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip3 install bravado
python3 run_md.py
```

This will take about 2 minutes to complete.
